            <div class="overflowTest">
                <p class="mat-body">In 1954, a handful of Palestinian immigrants on Chicago’s famous Southside
                    established
                    the
                    Mosque
                    Foundation of Chicago with the dream of one day building a structure to house the religious and
                    cultural
                    activities
                    of their growing young families.
                    Today, that dream is reality as the Mosque Foundation has become one of the busiest mosques in
                    America,
                    serving
                    a
                    community of more than 50,000 Muslims. </p>

                    Built in 1981 on a few acres of swampy land in the middle of mostly abandoned prairie in Bridgeview,
                    the Mosque Foundation began as a small structure with a maximum prayer hall capacity of 300
                    worshippers.
                    No one could foresee that the mosque’s establishment would inspire a Muslim neighborhood of hundreds
                    of
                    beautiful
                    new homes around the mosque,
                    two full-time Islamic schools at its perimeters, a Community Center down the road, and dozens of
                    thriving
                    businesses.

                    The community has steadily diversified to include Muslims of many languages and experiences—all
                    praying
                    side-by-side.
                    Imams are active in education, counseling, spiritual guidance, and arbitration. Community members
                    work
                    with
                    local
                    and national Islamic, interfaith,
                    and civic organizations on numerous initiatives such as protecting American civil liberties,
                    empowering
                    Muslims,
                    improving the quality of urban life, and helping the poor, the immigrants, and the oppressed by
                    advocating for
                    justice and peace.

                <p class="mat-body">
                    Very early on, Chicago area Muslims rented various sites around the south side of Chicago to hold
                    congregational
                    Eid
                    Prayers and celebrations.
                    Friday prayers were sometimes held in storefront properties of Muslim-owned businesses. As the
                    population of the
                    Muslim community grew, the need was realized to purchase property.
                    So, in 1963, a church located at 6500 S. Steward Avenue was purchased and converted into a prayer
                    hall
                    and
                    school
                    for the community of more than a hundred Arab Muslim families living in the southwest side of
                    Chicago at
                    the
                    time.
                    Arabic language and religion classes were held in the Steward property, as well as various community
                    functions.
                    Several years later, the building was sold to purchase a storefront property at 79th and Clyde
                    Avenue.

                <p class="mat-body">
                    The Clyde property was sold shortly thereafter, with the proceeds reserved to purchase land in
                    Bridgeview, where
                    the
                    Mosque currently stands. Designs of the Mosque were presented in 1977, and construction began in
                    November 1978.
                    Three years later, in 1981, the doors to the Mosque Foundation were officially opened, and the first
                    congregational
                    prayers were held. All five daily obligatory prayers and Friday congregational prayers were offered
                    from
                    the
                    start,
                    as well as nightly Taraweeh prayers during the month of Ramadan.
                    Quran recitation classes, Hadith lectures, and regular monthly meetings were established to serve
                    the
                    spiritual
                    and
                    social needs of the community.

                    It is impossible to overestimate the impact the Mosque Foundation has had on the community,
                    particularly
                    the
                    youth.
                    While a youth group was formed very early on to cater to the needs of the younger generation, a
                    separate
                    building
                    designated for the youth was purchased and opened in 1996.
                    We have witnessed young men who seemed destined to a life of crime and violence become outstanding
                    citizens who
                    are
                    now students and professionals in a variety of fields, due largely in part to those dedicated youth
                    mentors.

                    During the 1990’s, the Mosque Foundation community expanded greater than anyone could have
                    predicted.
                    The growing needs and increasing numbers required the Mosque Foundation to expand its original
                    facility,
                    which
                    was
                    completed in 1998.
                    Yet, even as the new prayer area nearly doubled in size, two Friday Congregational Prayers and two
                    evening
                    Ramadan
                    Taraweeh Prayers were still needed to serve the large community.
                    Among the many functions of a mosque is to serve the needy, and its various roles in serving the
                    community
                    continues
                    to grow. For example, in 2005 the Mosque Foundation opened a Community Food Pantry to help combat
                    hunger
                    for low
                    income families in the local community.
